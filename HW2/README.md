# Homework 2: Differentiation in Local Analysis

This directory contains the implementation of differentiation of a quadratic function and a cubic function.

* First order and second order approximations of the first derivative of the quadratic function are calculated to observe the truncation error and round-off error.

* First order and second order approximations of the first derivative of the cubic function are calculated to observe the Richardson error estimation.

A pdf report tabulating all the observations is generated.
