# Programming Assignment 4: Compact SPICE for ODE Solutions

This directory contains an implementation of forward Euler and Runge-Kutta method (RK34 with and without adaptive steps) to solve the generic ODE of the form of dx/dt = f(t,x). These solvers are implemented in ode_solver.py and verified by the script ode_verification.py. Simple RC-circuit simulation and common-source amplifier circuit simulation is performed as described by tasks 4 and 5 of the assignment, repectively. The scripts simple_rc.py and cs_amplifier.py can be run to perform these simulations and generate plots and execution time reports in the reports directory.
