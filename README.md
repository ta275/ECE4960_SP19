# Computational and Software Engineering

This directory contains the implementation of a sparse matrix representation data structure, numerical methods for calculating derivatives and definite integrals, numerical linear-equation solvers based on the Newton-Rhapson method, least-squares fitting, and ordinary-differential equation solvers to simulate electrical circuits.

Python 3.7 is used as the primary programming language for these implementations.
